# Processing

There's a ton of operations a processing plant could do apart from just processing and packaging the milk.
Capabilities of a processing plant (might vary depending on the location):
1.	Pasteurizing,
2.	homogenizing,
3.	Cream Extraction or Fat/SNF removal,
4.	Cream Combiner or Fat/SNF mixer,
5.	Milk condenser,
6.	Using the extracted cream, 
7.	to create butter - salted/unsalted,
8.	using butter to create ghee/clarified butter,
9.	sweets using butter and milk,
10.	Extracting skim milk,
11. And so on, we can add later.


There’re 11 20Kilo litre silos to store the incoming milk from the tankers, by default these are run through a filter and pasteurizer to clear out any germs that could’ve crept in during the transport. 

### Batches of milk processing

Batches are created to create bite sized protions of what to be processed and also based on the requirements from the sales team for tomorrow. Since the milk distributed to different locations, production team will prepare batches of milk that’s required to be packaged in a similar configuration. ***Batch*** denotes the milk type/configuration that’s going out that the next day.

- Each batch should have: milk type, %Fat, %SNF, and other attributes which will be added later on.
- Once there’re created in the system, they should be approved before actually processing the batches.

### TODO: Improve this segment. Written down for not losing the train of thought.
- Once approved/corrected: fixed and re-approved, after processing and  packaging, create the milk types for that day and fixate the current batch as non editable. (Only for context, more on this later)
- Batches’ result should be used for sales as opening milk stock balance, which should also update the price change in the reports if there is any. (Only for context, let’s discuss this again.)
